# Imperial-Harvard

Biblatex Style for the Imperial College London-Harvard referencing style

## Usage

The package provides the package ImperialHarvard which will adjust various aspects of both the in-text citations and reference list in order to comply with the guidelines provided by the Imperial College library service, which can be viewed [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/library/public/harvard.pdf). Just include the .sty file in your working directory with your latex file or place it into your user packages folder. Make sure that you include the path to your .bib file as part of your preamble by including the `\bibliography{}` command.

### Notes on usage

At this point the style only effectively deals with electronic journal articles as these are all that I really use. I will try to update it for more reference types when I find the time.
