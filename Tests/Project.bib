abstract = {Viral protein synthesis is completely dependent upon the translational machinery of the host cell. However, many RNA virus transcripts have marked structural differences from cellular mRNAs that preclude canonical translation initiation, such as the absence of a 5' cap structure or the presence of highly structured 5'UTRs containing replication and/or packaging signals. Furthermore, whilst the great majority of cellular mRNAs are apparently monocistronic, RNA viruses must often express multiple proteins from their mRNAs. In addition, RNA viruses have very compact genomes and are under intense selective pressure to optimize usage of the available sequence space. Together, these features have driven the evolution of a plethora of non-canonical translational mechanisms in RNA viruses that help them to meet these challenges. Here, we review the mechanisms utilized by RNA viruses of eukaryotes, focusing on internal ribosome entry, leaky scanning, non-AUG initiation, ribosome shunting, reinitiation, ribosomal frameshifting and stop-codon readthrough. The review will highlight recently discovered examples of unusual translational strategies, besides revisiting some classical cases.},

abstract = {A diverse group of viruses subvert the host translational machinery to promote viral genome translation. This process often involves altering canonical translation initiation factors to repress cellular protein synthesis while viral proteins are efficiently synthesized. The discovery of this strategy in picornaviruses, which is based on the use of internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, opened new avenues to study alternative translational control mechanisms evolved in different groups of RNA viruses. IRESs are cis-acting RNA sequences that adopt three-dimensional structures and recruit the translation machinery assisted by a subset of translation initiation factors and various RNA binding proteins. However, IRESs present in the genome of different RNA viruses perform the same function despite lacking conservation of primary sequence and secondary RNA structure, and differing in host factor requirement to recruit the translation machinery. Evolutionary conserved motifs tend to preserve sequences impacting on RNA structure and RNA-protein interactions important for IRES function. While some motifs are found in various picornavirus IRESs, others occur only in one type reflecting specialized factor requirements. This review is focused to describe recent advances on the principles and RNA structure features of picornavirus IRESs.},

abstract = {The dicistronic assay for internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity is the most widely used method for testing putative sequences that may drive cap-independent translation initiation. This assay typically involves the transfection of cells with dicistronic DNA test constructs. Many of the reports describing eukaryotic IRES elements have been criticized for the use of inadequate methods for the detection of aberrant RNAs that may form in transfected cells using this assay. Here we propose the combined use of a new RNAi-based method together with RT-PCR to effectively identify aberrant RNAs. We illustrate the use of these methods for analysis of RNAs generated in cells transfected with dicistronic test DNAs containing either the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES or the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) cellular IRES. Both analyses indicated aberrantly spliced transcripts occurred in cells transfected with the XIAP dicistronic DNA construct. This contributed to the unusually high levels of apparent IRES activity exhibited by the XIAP 5' UTR in vivo. Cells transfected directly with dicistronic RNA exhibited much lower levels of XIAP IRES activity, resembling the lower levels observed after translation of dicistronic RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. No aberrantly spliced transcripts could be detected following direct RNA transfection of cells. Interestingly, transfection of dicistronic DNA or RNA containing the HCV IRES did not form aberrantly spliced transcripts. These observations stress the importance of using alternative test procedures (e.g., direct RNA transfection) in conjunction with a combination of sensitive RNA analyses for discerning IRES-containing sequences in eukaryotic mRNAs.},

abstract = {Translation initiation can occur by multiple pathways. To delineate these pathways by single-molecule methods, fluorescently labeled ribosomal subunits are required. Here, we labeled human 40S ribosomal subunits with a fluorescent SNAP-tag at ribosomal protein eS25 (RPS25). The resulting ribosomal subunits could be specifically labeled in living cells and in vitro. Using single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between RPS25 and domain II of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES), we measured the rates of 40S subunit arrival to the HCV IRES. Our data support a single-step model of HCV IRES recruitment to 40S subunits, irreversible on the initiation time scale. We furthermore demonstrated that after binding, the 40S:HCV IRES complex is conformationally dynamic, undergoing slow large-scale rearrangements. Addition of translation extracts suppresses these fluctuations, funneling the complex into a single conformation on the 80S assembly pathway. These findings show that 40S:HCV IRES complex formation is accompanied by dynamic conformational rearrangements that may be modulated by initiation factors.},

@article{Reynolds1995,
abstract = {The question of whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is translated by a mechanism of internal ribosome entry has been examined by testing whether insertion of HCV sequences between the two cistrons of a dicistronic mRNA promotes translation of the downstream cistron in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Deletion analysis showed that efficient internal initiation required a segment of the HCV genome extending from about nucleotides 40-370 and that deletions from the 3'-end of this element were highly deleterious. As the authentic initiation codon for HCV polyprotein synthesis is at nucleotide 342, this demonstrates that, besides 5'-UTR sequences, a short length of HCV coding sequences is required for internal initiation. This finding was confirmed in transfection assays of BT7-H cells and was shown to be independent of the nature of the downstream reporter cistron. The strong requirement for coding sequences is in sharp contrast to internal initiation of picornavirus RNA translation. As a probable correlate with this, it was also found that the efficiency of internal initiation was only marginally compromised when the authentic initiation codon was mutated to a non-AUG codon, again in sharp contrast with the picornaviruses. The finding that coding sequences are required for internal initiation has important implications for the design of experiments to test for internal initiation of translation of cellular mRNAs.},

The HCV IRES can form a binary complex with an eIF-free 40S ribosomal subunit. Next, a 48S-like complex assembles at the AUG initiation codon upon association of eIF3 and ternary complex. 80S complex formation is rate limiting and follows the GTP-dependent association of the 60S subunit. Efficient assembly of the 48S-like and 80S complexes on the IRES mRNA is dependent upon maintenance of the highly conserved HCV IRES structure.

Here we show that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) can direct translation without eIF2 and its GTPase-activating protein eIF5. In addition to the general eIF2- and eIF5-dependent pathway of 80S complex assembly, the HCV IRES makes use of a bacterial-like pathway requiring as initiation factors only eIF5B (an analog of bacterial IF2) and eIF3. The switch from the conventional eukaryotic mode of translation initiation to the eIF2-independent mechanism occurs when eIF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation under stress conditions.},

abstract = {Translation of most mRNAs is suppressed under stress conditions. Phosphorylation of the $\alpha$-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which delivers initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA(i)) to the P site of the 40S ribosomal subunit, is responsible for such translational suppression. However, translation of hepatitis C viral (HCV) mRNA is refractory to the inhibitory effects of eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation, which prevents translation by disrupting formation of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA(i) ternary complex. Here, we report that eIF2A, an alternative initiator tRNA-binding protein, has a key role in the translation of HCV mRNA during HCV infection, in turn promoting eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation by activating the eIF2$\alpha$ kinase PKR. Direct interaction of eIF2A with the IIId domain of the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is required for eIF2A-dependent translation. These data indicate that stress-independent translation of HCV mRNA occurs by recruitment of eIF2A to the HCV IRES via direct interaction with the IIId domain and subsequent loading of Met-tRNA(i) to the P site of the 40S ribosomal subunit.},

abstract = {Translation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is initiated at an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located at the 5???end of its RNA genome. The HCV IRES is highly structured and greater than 50{\%} of its nucleotides form based-paired helices. We report here that the HCV IRES is an activator of PKR, an interferon-induced enzyme that participates in host cell defense against viral infection. Binding of HCV IRES RNA to PKR leads to a greatly increased (20-fold) rate and level (4.5-fold) of PKR autophosphorylation compared to previously studied dsRNA activators. We have mapped the domains in the IRES required for PKR activation to domains III-IV and demonstrate that the N-terminal double-stranded RNA binding domains of PKR bind to the IRES in a similar manner to other RNA activators. Addition of HCV IRES RNA inhibits cap-dependent translation in lysates via phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2??. However, HCV IRES-mediated translation is not inhibited by the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2??. The results presented here suggest that hydrolysis of GTP by eIF2 is not an essential step in IRES-mediated translation. Thus, HCV can use structured RNAs to its advantage in translation, while avoiding the deleterious effects of PKR activation. ?? 2009.},

The 3'UTR interacts with 40S ribosomal subunit proteins residing primarily in a localized region on the 40S solvent-accessible surface near the messenger RNA entry and exit sites. This region partially overlaps with the site where the HCV internal ribosome entry site was found to bind, with the internal ribosome entry site-40S subunit interaction being dominant. Despite its ability to bind to 40S subunits independently, the HCV 3'UTR only stimulates translation in cis, without affecting the first round translation rate. These observations support a model in which the HCV 3'UTR retains ribosome complexes during translation termination to facilitate efficient initiation of subsequent rounds of translation.},

The essential IRES subdomains IIIb and IIId, and domain IV, adopted a different conformation in the presence of the cis-acting replication element and/or the 3'-untranslatable region compared to that taken up in their absence. Importantly, many of the observed changes involved significant decreases in the dimethyl sulfate or N-methyl-isatoic anhydride reactivity profiles at subdomains IIIb and IIId, while domain IV appeared as a more flexible element. These observations were additionally confirmed in a replication-competent RNA molecule. Significantly, protein factors are not required for these conformational differences to be made manifest.

abstract = {Studies of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication cycle have been made possible with the development of subgenomic selectable RNAs that replicate autonomously in cultured cells. In these replicons the region encoding the HCV structural proteins was replaced by the neomycin phosphotransferase gene, allowing the selection of transfected cells that support high-level replication of these RNAs. Subsequent analyses revealed that, within selected cells, HCV RNAs had acquired adaptive mutations that increased the efficiency of colony formation by an unknown mechanism. Using a panel of replicons that differed in their degrees of cell culture adaptation, in this study we show that adaptive mutations enhance RNA replication. Transient-transfection assays that did not require selection of transfected cells demonstrated a clear correlation between the level of adaptation and RNA replication. The highest replication level was found with an adapted replicon carrying two amino acid substitutions located in NS3 and one in NS5A that acted synergistically. In contrast, the nonadapted RNA replicated only transiently and at a low level. The correlation between the efficiency of colony formation and RNA replication was corroborated with replicons in which the selectable marker gene was replaced by the gene encoding firefly luciferase. Upon transfection of naive Huh-7 cells, the levels of luciferase activity directly reflected the replication efficiencies of the various replicon RNAs. These results show that cell culture-adaptive mutations enhance HCV RNA replication.},

abstract = {Studies on the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been facilitated by the development of selectable subgenomic replicons replicating in the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 at a surprisingly high level. Analysis of the replicon population in selected cells revealed the occurrence of cell culture-adaptive mutations that enhance RNA replication substantially. To gain a better understanding of HCV cell culture adaptation, we characterized conserved mutations identified by sequence analysis of 26 independent replicon cell clones for their effect on RNA replication. Mutations enhancing replication were found in nearly every nonstructural (NS) protein, and they could be subdivided into at least two groups by their effect on replication efficiency and cooperativity: (i). mutations in NS3 with a low impact on replication but that enhanced replication cooperatively when combined with highly adaptive mutations and (ii). mutations in NS4B, -5A, and -5B, causing a strong increase in replication but being incompatible with each other. In addition to adaptive mutations, we found that the host cell plays an equally important role for efficient RNA replication. We tested several passages of the same Huh-7 cell line and found up to 100-fold differences in their ability to support replicon amplification. These differences were not due to variations in internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation or RNA degradation. In a search for cellular factor(s) that might be responsible for the different levels of permissiveness of Huh-7 cells, we found that replication efficiency decreased with increasing amounts of transfected replicon RNA, indicating that viral RNA or proteins are cytopathic or that host cell factors in Huh-7 cells limit RNA amplification. In summary, these data show that the efficiency of HCV replication in cell culture is determined both by adaptation of the viral sequence and by the host cell itself.},

abstract = {Initiation of translation of hepatitis C virus and classical swine fever virus mRNAs results from internal ribosomal entry. We reconstituted internal ribosomal entry in vitro from purified translation components and monitored assembly of 48S ribosomal preinitiation complexes by toe-printing. Ribosomal subunits (40S) formed stable binary complexes on both mRNAs. The complex structure of these RNAs determined the correct positioning of the initiation codon in the ribosomal "P" site in binary complexes. Ribosomal binding and positioning on these mRNAs did not require the initiation factors eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F and translation of these mRNAs was not inhibited by a trans-dominant eIF4A mutant. Addition of Met-tRNAiMet, eIF2, and GTP to these binary ribosomal complexes resulted in formation of 48S preinitiation complexes. The striking similarities between this eukaryotic initiation mechanism and the mechanism of translation initiation in prokaryotes are discussed.},

@article{Lohmann2001,
abstract = {As an initial approach to studying the molecular replication mechanisms of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major causative agent of acute and chronic liver disease, we have recently developed selectable self-replicating RNAs. These replicons lacked the region encoding the structural proteins and instead carried the gene encoding the neomycin phosphotransferase. Although the replication levels of these RNAs within selected cells were high, the number of G418-resistant colonies was reproducibly low. In a search for the reason, we performed a detailed analysis of replicating HCV RNAs and identified several adaptive mutations enhancing the efficiency of colony formation by several orders of magnitude. Adaptive mutations were found in nearly every nonstructural protein but not in the 5' or 3' nontranslated regions. The most drastic effect was found with a single-amino-acid substitution in NS5B, increasing the number of colonies approximately 500-fold. This mutation was conserved with RNAs isolated from one cell line, in contrast to other amino acid substitutions enhancing the efficiency of colony formation to a much lesser extent. Interestingly, some combinations of these nonconserved mutations with the highly adaptive one reduced the efficiency of colony formation drastically, suggesting that some adaptive mutations are not compatible.},

abstract = {An in vitro system that supports the efficient growth of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and reflects its complete in vitro replication cycle has not yet been established. The establishment of a minigene RNA of HCV in mammalian cells could facilitate the study of virus-cell interactions and the molecular pathogenesis of this virus. We constructed a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase under the control of CAG promoter (AdexCAT7). A high level of T7 RNA polymerase was detectable for at least 11 days after inoculation. Cells infected with AdexCAT7 were then transfected with plasmids carrying the authentic T7 promoter, the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of encephalomyocarditis virus, a luciferase gene, and a T7 terminator (pT7EMCVLuc) or carrying the modified T7 promoter, the 5'UTR of HCV, a luciferase gene, the coding region of C-terminal of NS5B and the 3'UTR of HCV, a ribozyme of hepatitis D virus and a T7 terminator (pT7HCVLuc). Most of the cell lines examined supported a higher expression of luciferase by transfection with pT7EMCVLuc than with pT7HCVLuc. However, one cell line, FLC4, derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma, exhibited very high reporter gene expression with pT7HCVLuc. In this cell line, transfection with RNA synthesized in vitro from pT7HCVLuc induced a higher level of reporter gene expression than RNA from pT7EMCVLuc. The T7-adenovirus system for the synthesis of HCV minigenes in vivo provides useful information on the molecular mechanisms of HCV translation in human liver cells.},
